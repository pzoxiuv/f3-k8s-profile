Based on https://github.com/lovasoa/TPCH-sqlite 

1) tpch-bkp: needs to be present on the mounted volume
    - tpch-dbgen: backup file
    - queries.sql: 6 select queries

2) dbgen-script: this creates tpc-h.db
    - create_db.sh: shell script that calls sqlite-ddl and creates database
    - Dockerfile:
    - Makefile: make "SCALE_FACTOR=1" , "PATH_BKP=/mnt/local-cache/db"
    - sqlite-ddl: DDL to define the database
    - sqlite3-tpch-db.yaml: to create the job to create database

3) query:
    - Dockerfile:
    - test_sql.cpp: this program uses tpc-h.db to execute queries in queries.sql
    - tpch-query.yaml: to create the job for queries
