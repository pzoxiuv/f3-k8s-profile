To run the experiment, first set it up by calling the setup script
from the directory it is located in (should be /local/repository/f3/experiments/sql_srvless_exp):
    source setup_exp.sh

Then, from the same directory run:
    source run_srvfull.sh
And after that
    source run_srvless.sh

That will execute the experiments and print the results.
